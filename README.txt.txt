The brief description

The changes have done based on my feedback was that my code runs more better than before because there are more classes that divide the code into sections that when it compiles than its faster as the code apart from each other . The feedback was that there were errors with the way of structure the class based on what I said before was the correction. Another feedback was that had mostly commented within my code but now with part 2 have more comments. The last feedback that will touch on is on with the README file which said that I needed to explain more of how the software  runs and compiles . Now I have change the structure into steps that is more easy to follow and explains what happens if donâ€™t follow the steps or miss the steps that I set out.
